# AOD-Net
AOD-Net is a light-weight but effective end-to-end dehazing neural network.


It is very easy and fast for you to train or test.

For test:

We have offered test.py, relevant prototxt and data.
You can just use 'python test.py' with GPU/CPU, you can obtain your result in data/result.

Good luck for your research.

# Improved AOD-Net with Positional Normalization (PONO)
Pytorch version with [PONO](https://github.com/Boyiliee/PONO) will be updated.
